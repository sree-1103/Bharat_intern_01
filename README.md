üì± SMS Spam Classification

üîç Project Summary
Unveiled the power of text classification by developing a predictive model that accurately classifies SMS messages as spam or non-spam (ham). This project showcases how data science, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and machine learning can be applied to real-world communication challenges to improve efficiency and security.

üß∞ Tools & Technologies
Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Techniques: Text Preprocessing, Tokenization, TF-IDF Vectorization

Models Used: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix

üß™ Process Breakdown
1. Data Preprocessing & Exploration
Cleaned SMS data by removing punctuation, stopwords, and converting text to lowercase

Explored class distribution and word frequency using visualization and statistical summaries

2. Feature Extraction
Transformed raw text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF and Count Vectorization

Handled high-dimensional sparse data effectively for model input

3. Model Training & Evaluation
Implemented and compared multiple classifiers

Achieved over 98% accuracy with the Multinomial Naive Bayes model

Evaluated performance using confusion matrix and precision-recall trade-offs

üí° Key Insights
Short, keyword-rich messages are often flagged as spam

NLP preprocessing significantly impacts model performance

Text classification can reduce spam exposure and improve messaging quality in business communications

üöÄ What I Learned
Practical application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for real-world problems

How to balance data preprocessing with model performance

The importance of choosing the right vectorization technique and algorithm for text-based data
